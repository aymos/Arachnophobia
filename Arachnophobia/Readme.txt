About:
Baskets collect the spiders. If the color of the basket and spider match, you get +1 point else your score decreases by 1 point. Shoot the black spiders using cannon to get +1 point. If any spider falls on the base, it blocks that space for the cannon and your score decreases by 5 points. You can move the cannon left or right to any position on the base as long as the space you are moving to is clear. 
Your current score is displayed at the top right corner of screen.

REMEMBER : If a spider falls on your cannon, the game is over.

How to run:
-> Make sure you have OpenGL installed on your system. If not, refer OpenGL_installation.txt
-> The makefile compiles the code. (Type 'make' on the terminal)
-> Now type './phase1 [width] [height] [level] [cannon] [green bucket] [red bucket]' (on terminal) to run the executable. {linux}

	Where :
		 800 < width <= 2200
		 500 < height <= 1100
		 level - Integer Value >=1 
		-2.55  <= cannon <= 2.55	
		-2.55  <= green bucket <= 2.55	
		-2.55  <= red bucket <= 2.55
