UBUNTU based/similar distros 

Paste the following commands in your Terminal/Console. 

-- freeglut is an open source Development library of OpenGL/Glut. 

         "sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev" 


-- For newer versions of Ubuntu (>= 11.10) you have to install another package to 
   correctly link the libraries. 

         "sudo apt-get install binutils-gold"

For REDHAT/FEDORA based systems, run the following command: 

-> sudo yum install freeglut freeglut-devel 

This should take care of all the dependencies ie. mesa-libGL, mesa-libGL-devel, mesa-libGLU, mesa-libGLU-devel and some other ones too. 

To run any program on a mac/linux based system, you need to compile you're code with the flags: -lglut -lGL -lGLU 

eg: g++ -Wall -o main main.cpp -lglut -lGL -lGLU

For a WINDOWS based system, the easiest way to use glut for openGL would be by using Visial C++ 

You can get a licenced version of VS2010 from ss1: http://ss1.iiit.ac.in/softwares/Visual%20Studio/ 

You now need to get GLUT which can be done by following the steps here:

If you don't put the "glut" files in the default directory, you will have to do this additional step while setting up a project: 
-> Goto Projects, Settings, C++ tab, select Category - Preprocessor. 
In the additional include directory box give the path where GL/glut.h is present. 
-> Goto Projects, Settings, Link tab, select Category - Input. 
In additional library path give the location of glut32.lib
